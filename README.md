# New York Citi Bike Analysis in Tableau

## Background

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-share.jpg)

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

My plan for this project is to  build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Plan

**First task is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.** 

**Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). Worked with a timespan of my choosing in some cases merged multiple datasets from different periods.** 

**The following are some questions I wish to tackle. 

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

* Use some of the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 

A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

**Finally, final presentation**

* Created a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards to make it professional, logical, and visually appealing.
